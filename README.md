# How to Use APT-Hunter

The first thing to do is to collect the logs if you didnâ€™t and with powershell log collectors its easy to collect the needed logs automatically you just run the powershell scripts as administrator .

- To collect the logs in EVTX format
```powershell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedkhlief/APT-Hunter/main/windows-log-collector-full-v3-EVTX.ps1 -o windows-log-collector-full-v3-EVTX.ps1
. .\windows-log-collector-full-v3-EVTX.ps1
```

- To collect the logs in CSV format
```powershell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedkhlief/APT-Hunter/main/windows-log-collector-full-v3-CSV.ps1 -o windows-log-collector-full-v3-CSV.ps1
. .\windows-log-collector-full-v3-EVTX.ps1
```
> **Note**: Windows users please use the latest release : [Latest Release](https://github.com/ahmedkhlief/APT-Hunter/releases)

APT-Hunter built using python3 so in order to use the tool you need to install the required libraries ( **python3.9 is not supported yet**).

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

APT-Hunter is easy to use you just use the argument -h to print help to see the options needed .

` python3 APT-Hunter.py -h`

`usage: APT-Hunter.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-o OUT] `

`  -h, --help            show this help message and exit`

`  -p PATH, --path PATH  path to folder containing windows event logs in EVTX format`

` -o : name of the project which will be used in the generated output sheets`


The remaining arguments if you want to analyze single type of logs.

# Usage:

Analyzing EVTX files ,you can provide directory containg the logs or a single file and APT hunter will detect the type of logs.

```python
python3 APT-Hunter.py -p /opt/wineventlog/ -o Project1
```
- Hunting using String or regex :

```python
python3 APT-Hunter.py  -hunt "psexec" -p /opt/wineventlog/ -o Project2`

python3 APT-Hunter.py  -hunt "(psexec|psexesvc)" -p /opt/wineventlog/ -o Project2`
```
# The result will be available in two sheets :

`Project1_Report.xlsx` : this excel sheet will include all the events detected from every windows logs provided to APT-Hunter

`Project1_TimeSketch.csv` : This CSV file you can upload it to timesketch in order to have timeline analysis that will help you see the full picture of the attack .

`Project1_Logon_Events.csv` : ALl logon events with parsed fields (Date, User , Source IP , Logon Process , Workstation Name , Logon Type , Device Name , Original Log ) as columns . This CSV file you can upload it to timesketch in order to have timeline analysis .
# Docker
